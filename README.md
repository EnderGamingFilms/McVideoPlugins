## FallFaster
This plugin checks to see if a player has been floating in the air for 2 seconds. If the player has been in the air within that time frame it will add a speed modifier to that player.

## Commands
`/ff on` - This will start the plugin and its internal timer.

`/ff off` - This will stop & reset the plugin and player data.

`/ff help` - Will show all commands & permissions for the plugin.

## Issues
If players begin to lag/whiplash they need to run `/ff reset` to reset their speed. You can also do `/ff reset [PlayerName]` if you want.
